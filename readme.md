## Summary of Findings

In the exploration, I found that

* Borrower APR has strongly -ve relationship with prosper score
* 36 months loan term has the heighst frequency and wider Borrower APR range
* People prefer to take loan with 36 months term and it is not depend on the income range
* Peoples take loan for Debt consolidation more than any category 
* Students take the lowest loan original amounts 
* People with high monthly rate taking high loans 

## Key Insights for Presentation

For the presentation, I focus on the relation between those variables
(Listing Category & Loan Original Amount & Term & Borrower APR & Employment Status & Lender Yield & ProsperScore)
so i started to explore them firstly with Univariate Exploration after that Bivatiate Exploration and finaly with Multivariate Exploration
to write a conclution about the relationship between them.

* The relationships show that the loans with higher borrower APR and Lender yield tends to had a lower prosper sore
* People with full time and part time jobs had a lower borrower APR in all loan status 
* In each income reange when the loan original amount icreased the medina of 60 months term increase more than 12 and 36 months term medians
* It is interesting because the median of 12 months term of green loans category is higher than other two terms
* The reange of 12 months term in cosmetic procedure is largest than the other two terms
* Personal loan and student use loan taking 36 months terms only

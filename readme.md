# Prosper Loan Data Exploration
The final project in "Advanced Data analysis" NANO degree from Udacity 

## Overview
* The data contains information about 113,937 loan lists from  Q4-2005 till Q1-2014 
through 81 variables classified into 3 categories and explained through 81 variables,
the data provided by Udacity.
* Using Data Wrangling process [Gathering, Assessing, Cleaning]
* Using Exploratory and Explanatory Data analysis
* Visualize data using [ Univariate plots, Bivariate Plots, Multivariate Plots]




## Summary of Findings

* When Borrower APR increases the lender yield increase also.
* Borrower APR has a strongly -ve relationship with prosper score
* 36 months loan term has the highest frequency and wider Borrower APR range
* People prefer to take loans with 36 months term and it does not depend on the income range
* Peoples take loans for Debt consolidation more than any category

## Key Insights for Presentation

For the presentation, focus on the relationship between those variables
(Listing Category & Loan Original Amount & Term & Borrower APR & Employment Status & Lender Yield & ProsperScore)
so I started to explore them firstly with Univariate Exploration after that Bivariate Exploration and finally with Multivariate Exploration
to write a conclusion about the relationship between them.

* The relationships show that the loans with higher borrower APR and Lender yield tend to have a lower prosper sore
* People with full-time and part-time jobs had a lower borrower APR in all loan status 
* In each income range when the loan original amount increased the medina of 60 months term increase more than 12 and 36 months term medians
* It is interesting because the median of 12 months term of the green loans category is higher than the other two terms
* The range of 12 months term in the cosmetic procedure is largest than the other two terms
* Personal loan and student use loan taking 36 months terms only
